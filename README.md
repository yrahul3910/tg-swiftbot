# Telegram SwiftBot

This is the code for SwiftBot (username: @swift_acronym_bot). It implements acronym expansion for Taylor Swift song names when used in conversations.

## Usage

Add the bot to your group chat to use it. It will automatically expand acronyms in Taylor Swift song names.

### Commands

- `/multi` - Turn on multi-acronym expansion. This will expand all acronyms in a message, not just the first one.
- `/nobot` - Turn off acronym expansion for a single message. This is useful if you want to use an acronym without expanding it.
